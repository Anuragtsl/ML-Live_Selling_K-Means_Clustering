# ML-Live_Selling_K-Means_Clustering

I have created Machine Learning Model With K-Means Clustering for Live Selling Prediction.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for Analysis, Vizualization and Model Development.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

# About Data

This dataset has been obtained from UCI ML Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+Live+Sellers+in+Thailand

Live selling is becoming increasingly popular in Asian countries. Small vendors can now reach a wider audience and connect with many customers.

# Results and conclusion

* In this project, I have implemented the most popular unsupervised clustering technique called K-Means Clustering.

* I have applied the elbow method and find that k=2 (k is number of clusters) can be considered a good number of cluster to cluster this data.

* I have find that the model has very high inertia of 237.7572. So, this is not a good model fit to the data.

* I have achieved a weak classification accuracy of 1% with k=2 by our unsupervised model.

* So, I have changed the value of k and find relatively higher classification accuracy of 62% with k=4.

* Hence, we can conclude that k=4 being the optimal number of clusters.
